Combatting noise:

We enabled high resolution mode and set the Filter cutoff, we experimented with a few different values
and didn't really notice changes.

We implemented a complementary filter according to what Swanson said in lecture, we set the 
constant to .4 because that gave us the smoothest data.

We also implemented a moving average on the data to smooth it out, which helped us quite a bit.
